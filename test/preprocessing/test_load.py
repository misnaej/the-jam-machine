"""Tests for the model loading module.

Placeholder for Phase 10 - Unit Tests.

Functions to test:
- LoadModel.load_model_and_tokenizer():
  - Test loading from HuggingFace hub
  - Test loading from local path
  - Test error handling for invalid model paths
  - Test device placement (CPU vs GPU)

Note: The session-scoped fixtures in conftest.py already exercise
the happy path. These tests should focus on error conditions and
edge cases.
